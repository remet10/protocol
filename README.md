> Zeedex Protocol is an open-source framework for building decentralized exchanges on Ethereum.



Zeedex is designed for developers looking to build decentralized exchanges without having to deal with the complexity and expense of designing, deploying, and securing their own smart contracts.

## Features

Zeedex 1.0 contains a single exchange contract called `ZeedexExchange.sol` with the following attributes:

* No order collision
* No possibility of front-running
* Accurate market orders
* Ability to collect fees as a percentage of the traded assets
* Allows asymmetrical maker/taker fee structure, rebates, discounts
* Multiple settlement models:
  * Wallet to wallet mode
  * Contract-deposit mode (supports ETH)
* Highly optimized gas usage

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```
To build json ABI files:

```bash
npm run compile
```

## Tests

```bash
npm run coverage
```

## Acknowledgments

Zeedex is inspired by the [0x project](https://github.com/0xProject).

In addition, projects such as [IDEX](https://github.com/AuroraDAO/idex) and [Paradex](https://github.com/ParadexRelayer) motivated the decision to focus on first order support for **off-chain matching**.
